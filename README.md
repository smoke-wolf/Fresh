Fresh analytics for views... that's all for now. ðŸ¥³ Increase your insights with every call to your tag! 

Use this project as a free demo hosted by us or deploy it as a fully standalone app on your own server. 

Hypothetically, you could create an incredibly intricate namebase for codes, with each code mapped to a specific action. When called, track how many times each code is executed.

| Code | Description                     |
|------|---------------------------------|
| s001 | Login Function Is Called         |
| s002 | Login Failed - Incorrect Password|
| s003 | Successful Login                 |
| ...  | etc, etc                         |
